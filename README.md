# Data110 – Week 1 GitHub Assignment

Welcome to my repository for **Data 110 – Week 1 Assignment**!

This GitHub space contains:

- `Markdown-Exercise.md`: My complete Markdown practice file  
- `README.md`: This introduction file

This assignment helped me practice using:
- GitHub  
- Markdown formatting  
- Headers, lists, links, images, tables, task lists, footnotes  
- Inline code and code blocks  

More assignments will be added to this repository throughout the semester.
