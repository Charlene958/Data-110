Nature has always been soothing to me — the calm water, lush greenery, and the sense of stillness.

The serenity of nature always helps me recharge my mind and creativity.

🎨 My Creative World

I love painting, drawing, reading novels, and singing.

Creativity gives me a space to express myself freely.
Whether I’m sketching, mixing colors on a canvas, singing along to music, or getting lost in a good book, I feel grounded, inspired, and joyful.

🎨 Interest	💖 Why I Love It	🏷️ Type
Painting	Expressing emotions through color	Creative
Psychology	Understanding human thought	Academic
Philosophy	Asking deep, meaningful questions	Reflective

🧠 Psychology & Philosophy

I also love psychology and philosophy because they explore:

💡 How emotions and behavior shape our choices

🌱 What meaning, purpose, and identity truly are

🌌 How the mind understands reality
